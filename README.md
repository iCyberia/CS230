##Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is a company looking to transform their existing game into a cross-platform, web-based version. In this game, players work in teams to solve puzzles depicted through images. Each game consists of four one-minute rounds where teams attempt to guess the image. 

##What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe my strongest contributions to the documentation involved thoroughly assessing the client's needs and limitations for their product, as well as detailing the server-side requirements and constraints.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document proved multiple benefits. It provided a solid foundation for understanding the project’s requirements, limitations, and suggested approaches. This understanding was essential for making a well-informed recommendation. Additionally, the document will act as a valuable reference to ensure that the development aligns with the client's specifications and the overall project goals.


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would update the recommendations section of my report. I should dedicate more time to thoroughly researching specific services and details that encompass the functionality of the game, from start to finish. Including a list of service providers, pricing, and framework options, along with the rationale for each choice.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User experience is paramount in software development, as exemplified by companies like Google & Apple. It’s essential to meet both client expectations and user needs. A complex and cumbersome interface can lead to user frustration, driving them to seek alternative applications. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing the software, maintaining clear/concise code is essential. Diagrams prove to be excellent tools for presenting different types of data in a format accessible to those without a programming background.
